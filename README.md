0/ Download the Arduino IDE if you haven't already: https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software    

1/ You may need to install a driver to get the Arduino IDE to recognize when your Arduino board is plugged into your machine. A driver has been included in this github repo, but please read more about that before proceeding - the process varies depending on your operating system. Some tips can be found at this link: https://medium.com/@shandou/a-chronicle-of-my-getting-started-with-arduino-journey-b9a2f7f20712  

2/ Download and install the RF24 and IRremote libraries for Arduino:
